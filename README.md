This project was made in PROMYS 2018 to generate data for q-Eulerian polynomials proposed by P. Gunnells (See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02446.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07398.pdf). As there is no known efficient way to generate q-Eulerian polynomials, this program is able to generate data for n=10, allowing us to make important conjectures.
