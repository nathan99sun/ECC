eulerian: This project was made in PROMYS 2018 to generate data for q-Eulerian polynomials proposed by Paul Gunnells (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02446.pdf). See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07398.pdf Definition 2.3, 2.6 for algorithm, also Appendix A for data. As there is no  previously known efficient way to generate q-Eulerian polynomials, this program is able to generate data for n=10, given data bounds, allowing us to make important conjectures about the properties of these polynomials. 
Secondary project: CIFARtest, seer1, and resnet are a CNN, DenseNet, and ResNet, respectively, trained on CIFAR100. Final commented accuracies are ran on 10 epochs each to compare the three models.
